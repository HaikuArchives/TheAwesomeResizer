## How it works (The "Manual")

- Drag'n Drop an image file on the window to show it, or click the dropzone for a file open dialog.
- Resizing the window (with the borders) resize the image.
- You can also enter the width and height directly.
- Uncheck "Aspect Ratio" and the image will fit the entire window.
- "Reset" resize the image to its original size, removing all effects along the way.
- "Undo" undo the last action done on the image.
- "Smooth scaling", to improve the visual quality of shrinked images.  (I tried to implement it to be done on-the-fly while resizing but I lost the "smooth resizing" feel, so I decided to put it separetly.  It only works with shrinked images)


- "Filename" contains the name of the file that will be created.
- "Format" Allow you to choose your preferred output format (you MUST select one).
- Click on the modified image and drag it out (in a folder or on the desktop) to create a new image in the choosen output format.
- You can also do a right-click drag to specify a particular region of the image to save !

- "Action" : (Use "Apply" to execute the choosen action)
	- 90 rotation : Rotate the image 90 deg counter clock-wise.
	- Flip Top-Bottom : Flip the image around the horizontal axis.
	- Flip Left-Right : Flip the image around the vertical axis.
	- Light : Lighten the image.
	- Darkness : Darken the image.
	- Blur : Usefull function to apply after having resized your image.
	- Melt : Home-made effect.
	- Drunk : Funny effect.  Use it on a screenshot with text in it and you will know where the name came from :-)
	- Black & White : Convert color image to Black and White image. (Cool !)
	- Invert : Invert the colors of the image (Not very useful but everybody has it, so...)
	- Swap X-Y : Swap the "X" and "Y" channels.
	- Screenshot : Take a screenshot of your current Desktop.
